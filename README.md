# Digital Altars

"Digital Altars" is a contemporary art project that marries traditional notions of sacred spaces with modern digital interactivity and multimedia. This project leverages the p5.js library to create an immersive, interactive web-based experience where participants can engage with digital representations of altars. By incorporating interactive elements such as touch, sound, and visual transformations, "Digital Altars" allows participants to contribute to or “alter” the digital space — offering a new canvas for spiritual and commemorative expressions and inviting reflection on the intersection of digital technology, art, and human experience.

## Technology

Technically, the project uses various p5.js features such as:
- Graphics and Animation: Draws and animates graphics to create visually captivating altars that evolve over time and in response to user interactions.
- Sound: Integrates p5.js's sound library to add an auditory dimension to the altars.
- WebGL for 3D Visuals: Employs p5.js's WebGL mode to create three-dimensional representations of altars, allowing users to interact with them in a more spatially engaging way.
- Touch and Mouse Interactions: Includes touch-responsive elements that make the digital altars accessible on mobile devices.
